What is React?

1) React is a JavaScript library (not a framework) developed by Facebook (Meta) for building user interfaces (UIs), especially Single Page Applications (SPAs).

2) It helps developers build reusable UI components that update efficiently when data changes.

Instead of reloading a whole webpage when something changes, React updates only the parts of the UI that need to change.

Why do we use React?



1) Component-Based Architecture

	Breaks UI into small, reusable pieces (e.g., Navbar, Button, Card).

	Easier to develop, test, and maintain.

2) Virtual DOM (Performance Boost)

	React uses a Virtual DOM (a lightweight copy of the actual DOM).

	When data changes, React updates only the changed parts instead of re-rendering the whole page → 	makes apps faster.

3) Reusable & Scalable

	Components can be reused across projects.

	Helps in building large, scalable applications easily.

4) One-Way Data Flow

	Data flows in a single direction (parent → child), making it predictable and easy to debug.

5) Rich Ecosystem

	Huge community, libraries, and tools (like Redux, Next.js).

6) Cross-Platform

	With React Native, you can build mobile apps (iOS/Android) using the same knowledge.

Why do we need React?

	It makes UI development faster, cleaner, and more efficient.

	Provides a better user experience with smooth updates without page reloads.
